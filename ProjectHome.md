wxPCRE is a cross-platform PCRE C++ wrapper that is built for use with wxWidgets. It was engineered to be a direct 'drop-in' replacement for wxRegEx (the native regular expression library). Since it's a custom wrapper it comes with some PCRE specific functions and abilities in addition to the helper functions implemented by me. This is the pcre library implementation wxWidgets style.
